##NY.GOV
This week, we highlight http://NY.Gov  

NY.Gov is run by Rachel Haot, a 30 year old NYU graduate who became New York City's first ever Chief Digital Officer at just 26 years old under Mayor Michael Bloomberg.  Rachel is a powerful example of how young people are playing an outsized role in driving societal change.

Rachel's work with Mayor Bloomberg, https://NYC.Digital, helped create a more nimble, responsive, and communicative government that played an [especially critical role](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/11/data-and-digital-saved-lives-in-nyc-during-hurricane-sandy/) in connecting New Yorkers in need with resources during Hurricane Sandy.  Her work at NYC.Digital laid the groundwork for her appointment by Governor Andrew Cuomo as New York State's first ever Chief Digital Officer.

Rachel recently [wrote about her work with New York State](http://https://medium.com/@rachelhaot/what-ny-gov-taught-us-about-service-design-284e507a2e75), in which she says:

  *"The future of digital government is mobile."*
