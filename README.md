Her work with Mayor Bloomberg, https://NYC.Digital, helped create a more nimble, responsive, and communicative government that played an especially critical role in connecting New Yorkers in need with resources during hurricane Sandy.  Her work at NYC.Digital laid the groundwork for her appointment by governor Cuomo as New York State's first ever Chief Digital Officer.

Rachel recently [wrote about her work with New York State](http://https://medium.com/@rachelhaot/what-ny-gov-taught-us-about-service-design-284e507a2e75), in which she says "The future of digital government is mobile."
